      <p>
        I am a current freshman in college pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree
        in Computer Science. My interests are focused on leveraging technology to
        make better decisions related to the medical field.
        
        My goal is to inspire and assist the next generation of engineers and scientists
        to pursue degrees in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics).

      <h5>Pressure Transient Analysis in Shales</h5>
      <p>
        <i>(ongoing work)</i>&nbsp PTA's rigor is brought to the forefront when analyzing dense
        data sets of pressure buildups as a result of well shut-ins. With fewer long-term
        shut-ins planned, PTA may not be seen in the same light as it used to. However, 
        with unconventional plays taking off and wells being drilled closer together, there
        is still great value in PTA. This work aims to review classical approaches,
        detail new advancements, and provide exhaustive recommendations for engineers and reservoir development.

      <h5>Real vs. "Fake" Gases in O&G</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>(in revision)</i>&nbsp Comprehension of hydrocarbon chemistry is key to successfully produce oil and gas.
          This article reviews important history and usage of the gas compressibility factor (Z-Factor).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Back to the Basics: The Liquid Diffusivity Equation</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>(<a href="http://www.fa-jimenez.com/assets/projects/01_Liq_Diffus_Eqn.pdf">link</a>)</i>&nbsp Sure, oil price is important. However, first you have to produce it from 1000s of
          feet below surface. Let's review how 3 "simple" equations describe the physics of fluid flow through
          porous media.
